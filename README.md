# CrimeCast: Forecasting Crime Categories

This repository contains my submission for the **[CrimeCast: Forecasting Crime Categories](https://kaggle.com/competitions/crime-cast-forecasting-crime-categories)** competition on Kaggle.

The goal of this competition is to predict the category of a crime based on incident details such as location, victim information, and other contextual features.
